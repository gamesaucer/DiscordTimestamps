# [Discord Timestamps](https://gamesaucer.github.io/DiscordTimestamps/)

Discord has a built-in timestamp formatter that can take any date and time and display it to whoever sees it in their local timezone. However, you have to specify a Unix timestamp and a formatting code, neither of which Discord helps you fill in. For that reason I built a little web app that lets you do it very easily.

Go to https://gamesaucer.github.io/DiscordTimestamps/ to use the app, and leave a bookmark so you can easily find it again!
